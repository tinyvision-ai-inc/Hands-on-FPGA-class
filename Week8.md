# Week 7: Getting into the real world
Other ways to code for Hardware:
CHISEL, High level synthesis, Amaranth, LiteX, CFU Playground

## Material
- [Module 8 Slide Deck](Slides/Hands_on_with_FPGA's_Module_8.pdf)

- Further Reading:
  - [CHISEL](https://www.chisel-lang.org/)
  - [Chipyard](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Chipyard-Basics/index.html)
  - [Hardware-as-code](https://www.hackster.io/sthibault/hardware-as-code-part-i-an-introduction-48bacb)

## Challenge:
- Install Chisel and the Chipyard on your computer (Beware, chipyard can take a loong time!!!) and play with it.
- Install Amaranth and apply some of the concepts you learnt in the class. You may want to try something simple like a counter at first and then start to stitch up more complex things like a CPU.
- Get [CFU-Playground](https://github.com/google/CFU-Playground) installed on your machine and go through the accelerator design. You should now have enough background to start working with this complex project and create your own accelerator flavors.
